# Philosophical Fundamentals Of Machine Learning

These are sample course materials for a class I taught at *Purdue University* in the Fall of 2024. The goal of the course is to give students a hands-on introduction to many contemporary machine learning methods through tools used in `python` such as `numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, and pytorch` and to then have them apply those methods to philosophical problems adjacent to machine learning such as the problem of induction. Some machine learning topics covered in the course include:

- Bayesian and PAC learning justifications for machine learning algorithms.
- K-Nearest Neighbors
- Linear Regression
- Multilayer Perceptrons
- K-Means Clustering
- Transformers

Some of the philosophical questions covered include:

- Are the No Free Lunch Theorems an example of the No Free Lunch Theorems?
- How should we measure the intelligence of machine learning systems?
- Do language models duplicate human moral reasoning?
- Are machine learning algorithms compatible with a right to an explanation?
- How can machine learning algorithms replace labor?
- How should we view the alignment problem through the methods of deep learning?

Students have to apply their learned machine learning methods through **four homework assignments** and a **midterm**. They then engage in a seminar-style course to discuss the philosophical import of those learned methods. Students demonstrate what they learn through a group project where they apply some machine learning methods to a topic covered in the second half of the course.

For more details, please see the syllabus. You can view some sample lectures and attendant Jupyter Notebooks in the SampleLectures and SampleNotebooks folders. To see the type of assignment, please look at the sample Homework assignment.
